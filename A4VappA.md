# Accounting for the Circulation of Capital

Appendix A at pp281-286 of A4V. This is based on DFoley UndCap (1986) chapter 5 "The Reproduction of Capital", pp62-90, especially 69-73.

This is similar to the appendix, discussing pp 69-77 of the above, at pp65-69 of RB 2014, which has been obsoleted by A4V. 

It remains necessary to consult the original version in DFoley UndCap, which is less cryptic.

That in turn is based on DFoley JET82, although that is not referenced in UndCap.

I have not looked up any papers citing the above and have only read the related pages 51 and 77 on "DuPont formula" entry
in the index to A4V. So I will return  to this after finishing first read of A4V and looking up related citations.

Meanwhile, I am particularly interested in this topic for reasons below.
