## I THE SVERDLOV STUDENTS’ QUESTIONS

...

10. What is your attitude towards the disputes that
are taking place among the economists on cardinal prob-
lems of political economy? (p191)

## II COMRADE STALIN’S REPLY (p196)

...

_Tenth question._ It seems to me that in the disputes
among the economists there is much that is scholastic
and far-fetched. Setting aside the external aspect of the
disputes, the main errors of the contending sides are
the following:

a) neither side has proved capable of properly 
applying the method of fighting on two fronts: both against
“Rubinism” and against “mechanism”;[^33]

b) both sides have been diverted from the basic
questions of Soviet economy and world imperialism into
the realm of talmudic abstractions, thus wasting two
years of effort on abstract themes—to the satisfaction
and advantage, of course, of our enemies.

With communist greetings,

J. Stalin

#33 “Rubinism” and “mechanism”—anti-Marxist revisionist trends
in political economy. Rubin, a Menshevik, revised Marx’s
teaching from an idealist bourgeois standpoint, emasculated
its revolutionary content and criminally diverted the atten-
tion of economists from the study of questions of Soviet 
economy and led them into the realm of scholastic disputes and
abstractions. “Mechanism” distorted Marxism in philosophy and
political economy from the vulgar mechanistic standpoint, and
was equivalent to denying materialist dialectics and replacing
it by the bourgeois theory of equilibrium. One of the chief
exponents of mechanism was Bukharin, ideologist of the Right
deviators. In the sphere of political economy, the mechanists
denied the internal contradictions of capitalist society and the
historically transient character of its laws of development, and
extended the laws of capitalism to Soviet socialist society. p. 196
